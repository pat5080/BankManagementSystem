This program functions in the same way as outlined in Assignment 1. All login credentials are located in login.txt. 
This file uses a delimiter '|' to separate between username and password, with the username being on the left of the 
delimiter and the password being on the right of the delimiter. 
The login.txt file can be found in 'BankManagementSystem->bin->Debug->netcoreapp3.1'. All files that are generated in
relation to account details are also stored in this folder.

On the first login screen you may enter

username: guest
password: 1234

Once you have successfully logged in you may choose to create an account in which your details will be emailed to an email account that was
provided when the account was created. Account text files are named by their account number.
